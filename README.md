                  Basic operations (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical)

  - ** Functions and Modules: Defining and Calling Functions, Function arguments and return values, Scope and lifetime of variables, Creatring and Importing standard modules

   - ** List: Comprehensions, slicing, and other data structure operations
             Example Problems to Practice

  - ** Touple
  - ** Sets
  - ** Dictionaries

  - ** Control Structures: Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
                           Loops (for, while)
                           Break, continue, and pass statements
